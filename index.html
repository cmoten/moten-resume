        <p>
          Strategic Operations Research Analyst with over a decade of experience
          leading theater-level assessments, campaign evaluations, and
          quantitative analyses supporting joint and interagency
          decision-making. Specialized in applying advanced analytics, modeling,
          and systems thinking to complex operational environments, particularly
          across Africa and Europe. Recognized for transforming how
          organizations assess effectiveness, measure progress, and evaluate
          alternatives under uncertainty. Routinely selected to lead
          high-visibility, mission-critical analytic efforts requiring
          ingenuity, methodological rigor, and integration across political,
          military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII)
          systems. Currently focused on strategic campaign assessment,
          data-driven decision support, and analytic leadership supporting U.S.
          Africa Command missions. Passionate about enabling senior leaders with
          clear, defensible insights that inform policy, planning, and
          operational choices in dynamic environments.
